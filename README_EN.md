## 1 Development Background

Previously, to quickly arrange images and import Markdown notes for group meetings, I wrote a PPT plugin, open-sourced on GitHub, which has now exceeded 500 stars: [Achuan-2/SlideSCI](https://github.com/Achuan-2/SlideSCI), Blog: [SlideSCI README](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/_NrGwjJnEta0oT5a6EKdiA)

Recently, while writing a paper, arranging images in Adobe Illustrator can be quite tedious.

- For example, if I need to add the same label to different images in the same position, it's very troublesome with native tools because I can only get absolute positions and have to calculate relative positions myself.
- For example, if I need to batch change the width and height of images, after selecting all images and entering specific values, it actually changes the overall size, and each image's size isn't the specific value I entered.
- For example, if I want to add labels to images one by one, changing numbers and aligning them is also tiring.

## 2 Feature Introduction

- Copy and Paste Relative Position:

  Usage Tips
  - Manually set the relative position of two objects: Modify ΔX and ΔY to manually set the relative position of two objects, for example, to make text 2mm from the top-left corner of the rectangle in the x-direction and 2mm in the y-direction.
  - When copying the relative position of one object, the default reference is the artboard, so you can move a shape out first, then modify the shapes below, and then paste back to the original position.
  - When copying the relative positions of more than two objects, the default reference is the first object, copying the relative positions of the subsequent objects to the first one. You can change the Order to adjust the object sequence. The plugin supports determining the order based on vertical position, horizontal position, and layer order. If you want to use the last object as the reference, check "Reverse Order", so the last object becomes the reference point.
  - When you need to unify positions across multiple objects on different artboards, check "Artboard Reference".

  Usage Scenarios
  - Manually set the relative position of two objects.
  - Quickly unify arrangement methods: If one group of images is already arranged, and you want to arrange another group in the same way, you can copy and paste the relative positions with one click to arrange them instantly.
  - Quickly unify label positions: If one image has a label, and other images need the same label position, you can quickly unify them.
  - You can copy the positions of multiple selected shapes based on the artboard for cross-artboard position unification.

​
- Batch Copy Shape Size:

  Copy the width and height of one shape or manually input width and height, then click Paste Size to batch paste to the selected shapes.

  There are checkboxes in front of width and height, default all checked. Check only one, for example, only width, then only paste width, height adjusts automatically based on original aspect ratio.

- One-Click Arrange Images: Batch adjust image width and height, one-click arrange neatly.

  - Column: Set how many columns to arrange into.
  - Row Gap: Row spacing.
  - Column Gap: Column spacing.
  - Resize Width: If checked, will uniformly set the Width of all objects.
  - Resize Height: If checked, will uniformly set the Height of all objects.
  - Order: Determine the order of objects. The plugin supports determining order based on vertical position, horizontal position, and layer order.

- Swap Positions of Two Shapes

  Uses

  - A group of images is already laid out, copy a set, then use the swap position function to replace the new images with the original ones.
  - After grouping images, need to modify, swap the positions of two images.

    【Set PlayerDebugMode】
   
   If the plugin shows a blank page after opening, you need to additionally set PlayerDebugMode to use this plugin.

   Steps to enable developer extensions (PlayerDebugMode=1)
    
    - Windows Solution
    
      - Press `win+r`, enter `regedit`, open Registry Editor.
      - Find `Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Adobe\` (you can paste directly in the address bar to jump), under the `CSXS.version number` folder: Right-click to create a new [String Value], name it PlayerDebugMode, then double-click and enter value 1. If there are multiple CSXS versions, you need to create PlayerDebugMode string for each version!!!

    - Mac System Solution
    
      - Open Terminal, enter
    
        ```bash
        defaults write com.adobe.CSXS.version number PlayerDebugMode 1
        ```
    
        For example
    
        ```bash
        defaults write com.adobe.CSXS.4 PlayerDebugMode 1
        defaults write com.adobe.CSXS.5 PlayerDebugMode 1
        defaults write com.adobe.CSXS.6 PlayerDebugMode 1
        defaults write com.adobe.CSXS.7 PlayerDebugMode 1
        defaults write com.adobe.CSXS.8 PlayerDebugMode 1
        defaults write com.adobe.CSXS.9 PlayerDebugMode 1
        defaults write com.adobe.CSXS.10 PlayerDebugMode 1
        defaults write com.adobe.CSXS.11 PlayerDebugMode 1
        defaults write com.adobe.CSXS.12 PlayerDebugMode 1
        ```
